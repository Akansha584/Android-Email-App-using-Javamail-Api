# Android-Email-App-using-Javamail-Api  
An Android App to send mail without gamil/email interaction!  
I haven't used the default Android Email Client to send emails instead used Javamail API to create my own email sender. And you can also use this App for Email.  
If it is helpful to you then follow me (you can give it a star too), I will make some more useful standard codes..   
Happy Coding :)
